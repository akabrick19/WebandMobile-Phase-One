      <h3>Where It All Began</h3>
      <p>
        The love for Labrador Retrivers started many years ago for Denise with a
        black lab mix named Scooter that they rescued from a junk yard. His
        previous name before they got him was "Sooner" since his previous owner
        would have rather seen him "sooner dead". His exact words when Denise
        took him was "Take him. He is stupid!" It was no surprise though that
        Scooter was anything but stupid and what his previous owner said about
        him was the farthest thing from the truth. He liked to play frisbee and
        when it would land accidently on top of the roof he would climb a ladder
        to retrieve it. Along with being a great retriever he was also a great
        babysitter for her toddlers at the time. When her son was the ages 4-6
        he would open Scooters mouth and put his head in Scooters to pretend
        that Scooter was a lion. The toddlers are now adults but Scooter was a
        part of most of their childhood. The stories of Scooter could go on and
        on but in short he was a great dog!

      <h3>First AKC Registered Labrador Retriever</h3>
      <p>
        Denises first AKC registered Labrador Retriever followed soon after
        Scooter. She was a yellow lab who they named Lil Bit due to the fact
        that she was the smallest one of the litter. Denise was able to be there
        for her birth and between the deliveries of the other puppies in the
        litter she ended up working on her for about 45 minutes to get her to
        respond and latch on to her mother. While Denise was doing all this her
        close friend who was the owner and breeder of the litter, was busy
        herself taking care of the whelping bitch. Now it should be mention that
        Denise did not want another dog but despite that it was 7 weeks later
        after Lil Bit was born that she came home. As the years went by a couple
        kids moved out and Denise married Dave Misaras in 2000. It was soon
        after that when her two kids, who were still living with her, along with
        Lil Bit and their cat, Dink, moved in with Dave. It was in 2004 that
        Denise made the difficult decision to have Lil Bit humanely euthanized
        due to the many health issues that she had. Unfortunately it was getting
        to a point where it was not in Lil Bits best interest to go through the
        rest of her life like she was. It was one of the hardest thing that
        Denise had to do and it was then that she told herself and Dave that she
        would never have another dog.

    <section id="Rain">
      <h3>Finding Rain</h3>
      <p>
        The promise of never owning another dog after Lil Bit lasted all of 72
        hours. After those few days of losing Lil Bit Denise started the journey
        to finding another AKC registered Labrador Retriever. It was certainly
        quite the task and took her over 7 months till she got in contact with
        Dale Brummett of Blackrock Labrador. Through many emails Dale let Denise
        know about Roger and Parke Dieckmeyer who had a litter that was sired by
        one of his dogs. It was from this litter of CH Blackrock Bravo to
        Barke's Shadow In The Night that Denise and Dave got second pick of the
        litter. Due to having Lil Bit Denise really wanted the one yellow girl
        that was in the litter but unfortanately that was Dales pick(Dale did
        have first pick). However, it all worked out in the end since the puppy
        that she did pick out turned out to be the true pick of the litter in
        Denises opinion. Rain was a Black Labrador Retriever and was definetely
        the queen of their lives! Rain was also the reason that Denise became no
        longer color blind to only wanting a yellow Labrador Retriever.

    <section id="Start of Showing">
      <h3>The Start of Showing</h3>
      <p>
        Eventually Denise and Dave became involved with the Huron River Labrador
        Retriever Club. Then eventually after that they started to show Rain.
        The members of the club helped Denise and Rain while they were first
        starting and despite just starting out Rain did really well. Showing
        Rain was what Denise did while Dave was out at fishing tournaments at
        the national and international level. Outside of fishing though Dave
        went along to the dog shows and the shows became almost as enjoyable for
        him as fishing was for him. Every now and then Dave will even take a dog
        into the show ring himself.

      <h3>Their Breeding Program</h3>
      <p>
        Dave and Denise love their dogs and will put their dogs needs above
        everything else. Each of their dogs have different personalities and are
        unique in their own ways. In their eyes their dogs are pets first and
        foremost and working dogs second. They have many different veterinarians
        who they trust and are experts in their own special field, like hip and
        elbow specialist or eye specialist, along with trusted general
        veternarians. They will only breed their dogs when they are planning to
        keep at least one puppy to add to their family. It is due to this that
        they only have one or two litters a year. They take breeding very
        seriously and have a small list of stud dogs that they consider to be
        bred to their females. Before any dog becomes apart of their breeding
        program they need to have their health clearances. This includes but is
        not limited to the dogs hips, elbows, and eyes being tested before
        becoming apart of their breeding program. This ensures that quality
        Labrador Retrievers are being bred that have great temperaments and are
        able to do any kind of work from field to show ring to service. Denise
        and Dave love the show ring but they also enjoy doing field work as well
        which is why they strive to have multi purpose Labradors.

      <h3>What To Expect With a Regen Labrador Retriever</h3>
      <p>
        Denise and Dave put a lot of time and effort into breeding Quality
        English Labrador Retrievers that are capable of doing whatever is
        required of them. Everyone should know that a Labrador Retriever is a
        fantastic family dog that can have tons of energy, especially as
        puppies! Their greatest joy is being challenged and having some kind of
        job to do. Through all the energy though they are very loving and loyal
        dogs who just want to have fun with their people. It is due to this that
        you can teach a lab to do almost anything and they will be as happy as
        ever! Anybody thinking of purchasing a Regen Labrador Retriever puppy
        should know that they will not go to their new homes until they are at
        least 8 weeks old. When a puppy goes to their new home they will have
        their first puppy vaccines, microchip and have been checked over by a
        vet. It is Denises and Daves hope that all their dogs, whether in the
        breeding program or not, live a long and happy life and are forever
        loved by the people around them.

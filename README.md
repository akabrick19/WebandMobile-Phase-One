# WebandMobile-Phase-One
The website for phase 1 of Web and Mobile app

All of the files for website are in the Webpages folder. I wrote javascript within the html files. The rest of the files are pictures and files I used for the website. Everything on the website is based off of Denise and Dave Misaras of Regen's Labrador Retrievers and I did get approval from them to do this project based on them. Also if the control flow diagram is difficult to see on the report I put the file to the image on this repository as well.
